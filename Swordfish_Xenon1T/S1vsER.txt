# Nuclear recoil energy as a function of S1 for the median
# of the nuclear recoil band in Xenon1T.
# Extracted from bottom panel of Fig. 2 of 1705.06655
# Corresponds to S1 values where the grey nuclear recoil
# contours cross the solid red nuclear recoil median line
# (extrapolated down to S1 = 0, E_R = 0).
# Columns: S1 (Photoelectrons), Nuclear recoil energy (keV)
