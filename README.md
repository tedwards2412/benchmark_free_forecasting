### Required packages
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- [WIMpy](https://github.com/bradkav/WIMpy_NREFT/)
- [Swordfish](https://github.com/cweniger/swordfish)

### Information
 - Scripts: Contains all the necessary files to generate the the Euclideanized signals needed to reproduce the plots in the paper
 - Notebooks: Contains notebooks to generate some of the figures as well as some scripts to make figures that take a while to produce
 - hdf5: Here is one of the hdf5 files required to make Fig 1. The rest are stored at XXXX
 - Swordfish_Xenon1T and DD_files: Simply contain txt files for backgrounds taken from figure in multiple references, for more details see paper. These files are required to generate the Euclideanized signals
